      Management, Privacy and Security</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The following is a list of frequently asked questions from FGB researchers
        on the topics of research data management (RDM), privacy (in particular,
        with regards to the European <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"
        target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>)
        and security requirements at the faculty and
        the VU. This list will be updated as regularly as possible as new
        developments are made, as new tools become available or as policies,
        guidelines, and other rules change.

                    In terms of priority, you should first determine
                    which concerns will add to the costs of your research so that
                    you can properly calculate how much funding you require from
                    your grant provider. In addition to data storage costs, there may also be
                    costs when hiring a third
                    party software provider or when receiving in-house
                    technical support from the faculty's
                    <a href="https://vu.nl/en/employee/behavioural-and-movement-sciences-getting-started/technical-support-for-research-to3" target="_blank">
                    Technical Support department.</a>
                    You should also start the processes related to setting up contracts
                    or getting privacy/security support as early as possible in your planning as
                    these steps can take quite some time.

                  privacy and security?</a>

                  <p>
                    Basically, privacy is about the rights of and risks for your
                    research participants. It doesn't matter
                    whether data was directly
                    collected from research participants or indirectly
                    obtained from another institution;
                    if data are about individual people and the data are not anonymous, then
                    it is necessary to protect the data.
                    (For more information on what is and isn't anonymous data,
                    see the question
                    <a href="#anonFAQ" class="ref_q1_priv"
                    onclick="return false;">The GDPR only applies to personal data,
                    but my data are anonymous.
                      Why do I have to worry about the GDPR?</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Security has more to do with the risks for FGB and VU Amsterdam.
                    Privacy plays a role in this.
                    If we don't sufficiently protect the privacy of research participants,
                    it can damage our institution's reputation,
                    which could make it more difficult to recruit participants in the future.
                    Good security keeps information
                    <a href="../rdm/definitions/Definitions.html#confidentialdata" target="_blank">
                    confidential</a> when personal information needs to be kept private
                    or when information needs to be kept secret for other reasons.
                    Good security also helps to minimize the risks that could arise from the loss
                    or corruption of your data.

                    FAIR data and open data are not the same thing.
                    It is also not a requirement
                    of the FAIR principles that data
                    be openly and publicly accessible to everyone in the world.
                    If the GDPR applies to your data,
                    it won't be possible make the data 100% publicly
                    accessible, but the data can still be made FAIR.
                    Oftentimes, you can openly publish the documentation and metadata
                    <em>about</em> your data; by doing so
                    you make your data more FAIR without making it publicly available.

                    Documentation and metadata that you can publish (as long as
                    there isn't any confidential information present) to improve the FAIR-ness
                    of your data include:

                    It's important to be aware that data that are subject to the GDPR must be

                    There are ways to manage access to the data even when they are stored on

                      Metadata are
                      data about data and there are both discipline-specific and
                      generic metadata. Generic
                      metadata, or project-level metadata,
                      provide details about what information your data contain,
                      where and when the data were created, and by
                      whom the data were collected/created, as
                      well as information for a reuser of the data about what
                      the terms of use are and how that reuser
                      can get acess to the data. Discipline-specific or data-level
                      metadata provide additional information
                      that is specific and relevant to certain types of
                      data and disciplines. Whether you
                      use metadata standards (also known as metadata schema)
                      or not, you <em>will</em> create metadata in
                      your research: any codebooks, cleaning and analysis scripts,
                      and other documentation about your research are all metadata.
                      However, by using internationally recognized metadata
                      standards for your research, you will
                      ensure that you record and report sufficient information so
                      that others can readily find your data, determine if they
                      are allowed to access your data, and, ultimately,
                      understand how to use your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the purposes of your DMP, it is generally sufficent
                      just to report which generic metadata
                      standard you will use to describe your data and research project.
                      CERIF, DataCite and Dublin Core
                      are all good metadata standards that are
                      frequently used to create generic metadata.
                      Because it's VU policy to register all archived datasets in
                      <a href="https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-portal-pure"
                      target="_blank">PURE</a>, which uses CERIF, you can report
                      in your DMP that you
                      will use, at a minimum, the CERIF metadata standard. If you
                      plan to archive your data in a trusted repository, the
                      repository may require that you use a specific metadata standard
                      that you can also report in the DMP.
                      Additionally, if your research involves surveys, you can
                      report in your DMP that you'll use the discipline-specific
                      <a href="https://ddialliance.org/" target="_blank">
                        Data Documentation Initiative(DDI) metadata standard</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you look up information about metadata standards, you
                      will see a lot of information about machine-readable formats.
                      These formatted metadata are usually created when
                      you fill in a form about your data.
                      For example, when you register your dataset in PURE, structured
                      CERIF metadata is created behind the scenes. That means for
                      your generic metadata, the most important thing you should
                      do is find out what information you will need to report for
                      a certain metadata standard and record that information during
                      your research, even in a simple text file. Then you will have that
                      information on hand when you need to report it later on.
                      For more information on recording metadata, including
                      templates for making your own machine-readable metadata, see this
                      <a href="https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata"
                      target="_blank">
                        page</a> from the CESSDA Research Data Management tutorial.
                      For your discipline-specific metadata, if you have structured
                      data and are using a codebook to describe all of your variables,
                      you can try making a
                      <a href="https://ddialliance.org/getting-started-ddi-c"
                      target="_blank">DDI codebook</a> which can be read by both
                      people and machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In addition to metadata standards, you may be asked
                      in your DMP about what ontologies, terminologies and/or
                      controlled vocabularies you will use. There is a lot of overlap
                      between these topics and metadata standards and some of the
                      concepts are quite complex. Ontologies have to do more with
                      taking the information reported in a metadata standard and
                      making that information understandable to machines. Most of
                      the work happens behind the scenes, so unless you are being
                      explicitly asked to figure out ontologies, don't worry too
                      much about that concept. What you can report in your DMP
                      are any standards for terminology or controlled vocabulary
                      you plan to use. You may already apply the concept of
                      controlled vocabularies in your research, e.g. in a survey where only
                      a specific set of answers are allowed
                      for questions about ethnicity, highest level of education
                      or language proficiency. Something that will make your data
                      more understandable to others is if you aim to use terminology
                      and controlled vocabularies that are (inter)nationally
                      agreed upon and well recognized in your discipline, rather
                      than generating new vocabularies and terminolgy just for
                      your research.

                      The FAIR principles were developed to give structure and
                      guidance in how to
                      achieve good data management, especially for data that
                      will be reused in the future
                      (by you, your research team, or other third parties).
                      There is no
                      requirement that FAIR data be made publicly available, a.k.a. open.
                      Additionally, just because
                      a dataset is openly available, doesn't mean that it is
                      FAIR. There are many
                      datasets publicly available right now that are not
                      reusable because there is
                      insufficient documentation about the data to be able to
                      fully understand, interpret
                      and use that data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The F in FAIR refers to findable data. This means that
                      an individual can
                      find the right dataset for their needs and purposes.
                      VU researchers can improve the findability of their data
                      by publishing metadata about their data on YODA or OSF, or
                      by registering their data in
                      <a href="https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-portal-pure"
                      target="_blank">PURE</a>.
                      It is a requirement at VU Amsterdam that all archived
                      data be registered in PURE. If you publish metadata
                      on OSF, this information will be imported
                      into PURE automatically. It is not currently possible
                      for metadata in YODA to be imported to PURE so you will
                      need to register this information separately in PURE.
                      It is imperative that data be registered in PURE so that
                      VU Amsterdam can better monitor and report on
                      data production activities at our institution.
                      <br/>
                      Another consideration for findability that isn't specifically discussed
                      by the FAIR principles,
                      is to strive to make your data findable to you and your
                      research team by using logical folder structures
                      and file naming conventions for
                      your datasets, scripts and documentation. This data management

                    <p> The A in FAIR refers to accessible data. This term
                      leads to a lot of confusion, but it does
                      <strong>NOT</strong> mean that your data must be publicly
                      accessible. It means that
                      there needs to be clear documentation regarding <em>how</em> the
                      data can be accessed, <em>if</em> appropriate. If the GDPR applies
                      to your data (which is the case for most data in the faculty), access
                      to the data should only be given upon request. There are several things
                      you will need to address when planning to manage access to the
                      data:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          You'll need to make participants aware that data may need to be
                          shared for verification purposes after the data been used in
                          a research article
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You'll need to obtain consent from participants to the sharing and
                          reuse of their data for new research purposes. They'll
                          need to be sufficiently informed about:
                          <ul>
                            <li> What those new research purposes
                              may be
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The kinds of third parties the data may be shared with
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Whether the data will leave the EU/EEA
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              How the data will be protected when shared with others
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          You'll need to plan how to manage ongoing access to the data.
                          You should document these plans, for example in your data management plan,
                          and ensure that this documentation is findable well into the future.

                        <li>
                          You'll need to determine how data can be safely shared with third parties.
                          This includes drawing up data sharing agreements. You can get help with
                          these agreements by contacting

                      The I in FAIR means data and metadata (data about data)
                      should be Interoperable.
                      Basically it means that both humans
                      and computers can properly interpret and understand the data and metadata.
                      One way to achieve this is using standards when
                      creating metadata or by using vocabularly that is also used
                      by other researchers in your field.
                      See the question
                      <a href="#metadataFAQ" class="ref_q6_rdm"
                      onclick="return false;">I'm
                        writing a data management plan (DMP) and the template is
                        asking about which
                        metadata standards, metadata schema, ontologies,
                        terminologies and controlled vocabulary I will use.
                        What does this mean? </a> for more information
                      about metadata. In addition to creating metadata about
                      your research data, you can also improve the
                      interoberability of your data by using open-source
                      software (e.g. R or Python) and data formats (e.g. csv, txt).
                      If someone needs to use proprietary software
                      to open and analyze your data files, then
                      the data are less readily interoperable.
                      <br/>
                      Additional
                      infrastructure at the
                      VU is being developed to support researchers in
                      meeting the Interoperability
                      requirement; this information will be communicated
                      as this infrastructure becomes available. For now,
                      focus on maintaining good documentation about your
                      data, for example, by:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Maintaining logbooks about data collection and cleaning
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Creating codebooks to describe variable names and value
                          codes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Saving all scripts, code or syntaxes used to clean and
                          analyse your data.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, the R in FAIR means reusable. In simple terms,
                      it's a summary of the F, A, I
                      aspects of the FAIR principles: if you meet those
                      requirements, your data should be reusable.
                      There are some more details that apply here, but those will
                      be explained as the FAIR data infrastructure at the VU
                      develops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is important to be aware that making your data FAIR does
                      not guarantee that
                      your data are of a high quality. Following the FAIR
                      principles only ensures that
                      data can be reused by others. The best way to ensure data
                      quality is to
                      effectively plan for research data management before
                      starting your research. Take
                      the time to think about which variables are necessary to
                      answer your research
                      question and whether the planned methods of collecting data
                      for these
                      variables could lead to unreliable results. For example,
                      if you are creating a
                      question in a questionnaire that contains both open text
                      fields (e.g. "other, namely", "Comments") alongside questions with
                      pre-defined answers, consider
                      whether there is a risk of collecting conflicting
                      information. There
                      isn't a perfect way to deal with such issues; it
                      ultimately depends on
                      what information you need to answer your research question.
                      If you plan ahead, however, you can choose different
                      ways to collect the necessary information. Or you can develop
                      a data cleaning protocol for managing any
                      inconsistencies as they arise; a documented protocol will
                      ensure that all members of your research team
                      clean the data in a consistent manner. Finally, any
                      data cleaning steps should be well documented using code
                      or in a logbook so that there is a clear record of how
                      data were modified prior to analysis. This helps with transparency
                      and prevents any questions about academic misconduct from arising.

                      Good research data management not only helps a research
                      project run more smoothly,
                      it can result in higher quality data and improve the
                      validity and reproducibility of your study results.
                      There have been cases where published studies have been
                      retracted because
                      the variables used in the analysis
                      were mislabeled, leading to completely invalid and
                      misleading results.
                      Clear documentation could have helped to avoid this.
                      Clear documentation also makes your data more understandable
                      to yourself, your internal research team and any future
                      users of the data.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                      Planning ahead with research data management helps you to
                      ensure the privacy and security
                      of your research data; for example, you may need to plan
                      out a good method for collecting
                      data outside the VU. Writing this down in a data
                      management plan gives everyone in your research team a clear
                      understanding of what their responsibilities are and shows
                      any data protection authorities
                      that you’ve considered the risks and taken appropriate and
                      strategic measures to minimize these risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Data management planning can also help minimize the amount
                      of work required to clean your data;
                      for example, by building validation checks into your data
                      entry forms, you prevent impossible values (e.g. age of 200)
                      from being entered.
                      Additionally, if you will be using questionnaires in your
                      research and you take the time
                      during data management planning to think about the structure
                      of your questionnaire,
                      you can determine where and when open text fields are
                      absolutely necessary, minimizing the amount of
                      text data that will need to be recoded into categorical
                      data during data processing.

                    <p>
                      Finally, data management planning helps with preparing for
                      archiving and publishing of research data.
                      Data archiving after an article is published is a
                      requirement of the
                      <a href="https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/publications/Netherlands%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20for%20Research%20Integrity%202018.pdf"
                      target="_blank">VSNU Code
                      of Conduct for Research Integrity</a>.
                      There have been numerous cases around the world where
                      research publications
                      have been retracted because the original data were not
                      findable, meaning that the validity of the research findings
                      could not be confirmed.
                      Additionally, data should not only be archived to
                      allow for verification of research findings, but also
                      described clearly and effectively
                      through documentation and metadata so that others who
                      may need to check
                      the data can fully understand the data
                      and interpret them. Archiving takes a lot of work, but
                      the stress of archiving can be
                      reduced if you plan ahead for it during your data management
                      planning (by thinking ahead about
                      what parts of your research need to be archived, what
                      documentation is necessary to understand the data
                      and which archiving location should be used.)

                      These are just a few examples of how research data
                      management plays a role in how smoothly your research
                      project will run. It’s not necessary to know all of the
                      details about data management at the start of your research,
                      but it is important to document what <em>is</em> known at
                      the start of a project and to regularly review and update
                      the data management plan as more information becomes
                      available.

                      <p>
                        This is a complex issue. The GDPR has broadened the definition of personal data to:
                        “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an
                        identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
                        in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
                        location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
                        physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
                        It is the indirect identification of individuals that makes it difficult to say with certainty
                        that data about people are anonymous because through the combination of several indirect identifiers
                        or by coupling these identifiers with publicly available data a person could
                        actually be quite easily identified. In a world of Big Data, AI and learning algorithms
                        it's almost never possible to 100% guarantee anonimity when data about
                        people are collected. Additionally the rules that the Dutch Data Protection Authority
                        applies when considering if data are anonymous are quite strict. For data about people to
                        be anonymous, the following three conditions must all apply:
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Is must not be possible to single out a unique individual within the dataset
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            It must not be possible to couple together separate records on an individual
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            It must not be possible to infer, with significant likelihood, additional
                            data values about an individual based on the data available in the dataset
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Because of these very strict rules, the faculty advises all researchers using data about humans
                        to treat such data as personal data under the GDPR. This means that all
                        data about people should be protected with at least some security measures such as those suggested in this
                        <a href="../Security/SecurityBasics.html" target="_blank">

                        these data should be saved in a pseudonymized manner (i.e. no names and contact information
                        stored in the same dataset as the research data) and these data should be stored on and shared through VU
                        approved facilities.

                    <h6>GDPR Rules and Requirements</h6>
                    <a href="#q3_priv" data-toggle="collapse">Am I allowed to collect BSNs from research participants?</a>
                    <div id="q3_priv" class="collapse" >
                      <p>
                        No.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Newer privacy requirements in The Netherlands <strong>do not allow</strong> us to collect BSNs anymore.
                        In the past, researchers whose studies offered financial compensation to participants were required to collect
                        administrative information, including BSNs, and submit this information to VU Financial Affairs.
                        <strong>This is no longer required</strong>.
                        The Dutch Tax Authority has now changed its procedures and research participants are responsible
                        for filing income from research participation (if the total annual compensation is above €1500).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It is also not allowed to collect BSNs for any other research purposes. If, for some reason, this information
                        is imperative to your research, you <strong>must</strong> contact
                        <a href="mailto:privacy@vu.nl">VU Legal Affairs</a> <strong>prior</strong> to starting
                        your research to determine whether there is any valid legal argument for you to collect BSNs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>You are not allowed to collect BSNs without the approval of the VU Legal Affairs department</strong>

                        Under the GDPR, it is no longer necessary to register the processing of personal
                        data with the Data Projection Authority for the Netherlands. Instead a data processing
                        registry must be maintained by the VU. In order to meet this requirement, you are
                        asked to complete a data management plan (DMP) or registration form via
                        <a href="https://dmponline.vu.nl/" target="_blank">DMPonline</a>. First log in
                        to DMPonline with your VUnet ID and then:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Select "Create plans"</li>
                          <li>Make sure Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is listed under "Select the primary
                            research organisation"</li>
                          <li>Under "Select the primary funding organisation" select the box that says
                          "No funder associated with this plan"</a>
                          <li>Once "Which DMP template would you like to use?" appears select either:
                            <ul>
                              <li>The VU DMP template if you still need to write a data management plan.
                                This is the default option for most cases and this DMP is approved by both
                                NWO and ZonMw for their grant applications.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                The GDPR registration form if you have already written a DMP
                                without using DMPonline (or if you used a DMPonline template other than the "VU DMP template
                                2021 v1.3"). This option allows you to enter the necessary
                                information for the processing register without
                                have to write a new DMP.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                        Once you have completed the appropriate form in DMPonline, this information
                        will be imported to th VU's processing register.

                        Unfortunately, this isn’t really something that can be avoided, particularly
                        when the information is coming from participants or their parents. With regards to
                        institutional third parties such as schools, hospitals or clinics that you are working with,
                        contact the institution to determine whether data will continue to be transferred in this way
                        so that a safe method can be agreed upon. If data will continue to be shared with you in this way,
                        you should set up data transfer methods in line with this
                        <a href="../Security/DigitalTransfer.html" target="_blank">
                          guide</a>. For example, it's possible to set up access to a
                        SURFdrive file or create a guest user in SURFFileSender for third parties
                        including for those that don't normally have access to SURF products. SURFdrive
                        and SURFFileSender are safer methods than e-mail is that your partners can
                        use if they need to share sensitive information with you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you receive a single e-mail containing sensitive information,
                        simply contact the sender to say you have recorded the
                        information in a safe location and deleted the e-mail. Advise the sender to delete
                        the e-mail from their outbox and then let him or her know that e-mailing is not a
                        particularly safe method for sending sensitive information; if sensitive information
                        needs to be sent again in the future, advise the sender to first contact the research
                        team to set up a safer method of transfer, such as with ZIVVER. You can
                        find more information on ZIVVER on this

                        It is understandable that if A LOT of these kinds of e-mails are received,
                        that they will not be addressed immediately. Just try to manage them
                        in a timely manner; your research team can document in your research data
                        management plan or data protection impact assessment
                        what standard response you should send when receiving these
                        e-mails and the time frame within which you will address these e-mails. The GDPR
                        does not define any time frame to manage such situations; instead you simply need
                        to document how you handle personal data, so it is your responsibility to define
                        a reasonable time frame (for example, 2 weeks), then document that time frame
                        and stick to it.

                        Under the GDPR,
                        there are specific rules you must follow if you plan to

                        The most feasible

                        that has an adequate level of data protection
                        according to the European Commission.
                        Note that in Canada, this only applies to

                        then it is not absolutely necessary to renew consent under the GDPR, but you
                        will need to document clearly in a data management plan or data protection impact

                        It is generally preferred that consent be obtained with a paper consent form, but
                        in many cases, it may be more appropriate to use digital consent.
                        If your research is not medical in nature and not subject
                        to any of the medical research regulations (namely, the WMO law, the GCP guidelines or the Medical Device Regulation),
                        then there are no restrictions on using digital consent instead of paper consent.
                        If you are conducting medical research and it is subject to any of the medical research regulations, you should check with the
                        <a href="mailto: metc@vumc.nl"> VUmc METC</a> as to whether paper consent forms are required. As of mid-2022
                        digital consent is allowed in some <a href="https://www.ccmo.nl/publicaties/publicaties/2022/08/31/handreiking-elektronische-toestemmingsverlening"
                        target="_blank">cases of WMO-research</a>, but you should always check with the METC
                        if your research is allowed to use digital consent.

                        If digital consent is an option for you, the second thing you want to
                        ensure is that you can obtain consent legally:
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Potential participants must have
                            consented to their contact information being used for such a purpose before you
                            contact them. For example, you could receive a list of potential participants that are
                            recruited by an external partner, but first that external partner must have
                            obtained consent to share the e-mail addresses with us so that we can
                            contact the potential participants about participating in our study.

                          <li>
                            You want to make sure you are contacting and obtaining consent from
                            the correct person. The best way to do that is with a form of 2-factor
                            authentication with the help of the ZIVVER tool. This

                            will help you with setting up ZIVVER and using it for obtaining consent.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are running a survey with a panel provider (see the question

                        Make sure the information provided to participants, as well as the way consent is obtained, follows the requirements of this

                        Check first if the VU or FGB already has a contract with the company
                        you wish to hire or with another company that provides a similar solution.
                        The <a href="mailto: research.data.fgb@vu.nl">FGB Privacy Champions</a>
                        can help you with this. Also check if the faculty
                        technicians

                        could create an in-house solution for you so that an external
                        company doesn't need to be hired.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If a new company needs to be hired, use the standard VU model processing agreement,
                        which you can obtain from the <a href="mailto: research.data.fgb@vu.nl">FGB Privacy Champion</a>.
                        The main text of this model agreement must not be changed, but the annexes at the end of the
                        agreement need to be filled in. Contact
                        the <a href="mailto: research.data.fgb@vu.nl">FGB Privacy Champion</a> to review Annex 1 and contact
                        the <a href="mailto: rdm@vu.nl" target="_blank">RDM support desk</a>
                        to get support from an IT expert who can review Annex 3 to check that the security measures of the company are sufficient.
                        Be aware: it's very likely that the IT expert who will review Annex 3 will want to see a data classification about
                        the data that will be collected or stored by the company you are hiring. This will help the expert in their
                        assessment as to whether the security measures are sufficient. You can complete a data classification
                        with this <a href="https://vu.nl/en/research/dataclassification" target="_blank">tool</a>, although check first
                        with your supervisor or research teammembers as to whether a data classification has already been completed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Please note that some companies will wish to use their own model processing agreement. If it’s absolutely not possible to
                        use the VU model then it may be possible to use the model of the company; however the FGB Privacy Champion will
                        need to check the processor's model to make sure it meets the needs of the VU.

                      <p>
                        In all cases, setting up a processing agreement with an external company will take time, regardless of
                        which model agreement is used. To help avoid trying to set up such agreements last minute, make sure to plan
                        ahead in your data management planning as to whether an external company needs to be hired so that
                        the process of setting up an agreement with that company happens well before data collection needs to begin.

                        If you are using a panel provider to recruit participants by having the provider
                        share a link for your survey, there is no need to set up a processing agreement
                        with that provider. The provider is in this case an independent controller, according to
                        the GDPR, meaning they are responsible for the data they collect and maintain; the VU
                        is also an independent controller and we are responsible for the data we
                        collect through the surveys. But neither party sees that data of the other party
                        so there is no need for an agreement. This applies even if the panel provider
                        is located outside of the EU/EEA.
                      </p>

                        If you are using panel providers to recruit participants located outside the EU/EEA,
                        be aware that other privacy laws may apply to the data collected;
                        the VU is required to meet both GDPR requirements
                        and international privacy laws when working with international participants.
                        Finally, the only other thing to keep in mind when recruiting participants with panel providers
                        is that you must ensure that you have a GDPR-compliant informed consent process at the
                        start of the survey. Review this

                        The VU has developed model agreements for situations where the VU functions as a

                        In order to assess what kind of privacy agreements are necessary, start by determining if
                        the VU and the third party are joint controllers (see the question <a href="#roleFAQ" class="ref_q8_priv" onclick="return false;">

                        a joint controller agreement needs to be signed; you can obtain a model agreement
                        from the <a href="mailto: research.data.fgb@vu.nl">FGB Privacy Champion</a>. You should also consider
                        where the research data will be collected from and stored because if all data are maintained
                        externally by the third party and the PhD candidate is employed by that third party,
                        generally no joint controller or data sharing agreements are required. However, if the
                        third party has no facilities for maintaining the data long-term after the research
                        project is complete (namely for archiving the research data) data may need to be transferred to the
                        VU at which point a data sharing agreement and potentially a joint controller agreement will be
                        necessary. You can contact <a href="mailto: legal@vu.nl">Legal Affairs</a> for help with drawing up a data sharing agreement.

                        If the data are higher risk, but the guidance above isn't feasible, one solution is to

                      <p>
                        This is a complex question. Ultimately the VU would bear the brunt of the responsibility
                        if a breach occurs. However students are responsible for handling data carefully according to
                        the requirements of the VU. In order to ensure students behave appropriately while under VU supervision,
                        students must carefully read, understand and sign confidentiality agreements before they work with
                        research data. If students will be collecting or transporting data outside of the VU or they will
                        be borrowing equipment from the TO3 Borrowing Service, they must also read this

                        so that they know how to carefully handle the data until they can store it in a safe VU
                        location. It is also a good idea to develop a protocol for collecting data outside the VU that will be documented in the
                        data management plan so that everyone collecting and transporting data knows what their responsibilities
                        are; having clear, documented procedures that everyone must follow will minimize
                        the risks of leaking data.

                        If the student will be conducting research under the sole supervision of the VU
                        and there isn’t another third party (e.g. a hospital, long-term care centre, physiotherapy
                        clinic etc.) involved in the data collection, then a confidentiality agreement can be obtained
                        from your department or section head. He or she can also sign this agreement on behalf of the
                        Director of Operations for the Faculty. If all data collection and data storage will take
                        place at the location of a third party, and the only role for the VU is to provide
                        supervision for the research internship, then the third party is responsible for
                        setting up a confidentiality agreement with the student.

                        review the confidentiality agreement template in this situation to make sure
                        that there isn't anything in the agreement that might a problem for the

                        you complete a DPIA by completing a pre-DPIA. You can contact the

                        The most important thing you should do is clarify in the information letter shown to potential survey
                        respondents how many times they are allowed to participate. Also state that responses to your survey that are clearly fraudulent
                        (e.g. it's clear that a bot was used to repeatedly fill in the survey) will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be compensated.

                      <p>
                        Some survey programs, like Qualtrics, offer technical methods to help prevent fraud, however
                        these methods are not very effective and if you use them, you will need to include additional information about cookies
                        in the information you give to your participants. It is therefore recommended to <strong><em>not</em></strong>
                        use these methods and instead simply monitor for signs of fraudulent responses,
                        such as surveys completed repeatedly from very similar
                        e-mail addresses and survey completion times that are impossible for a human to achieve.

                          There are two options for video calling at VU Amsterdam: Microsoft Teams and Zoom.
                          Zoom should only be used in non-sensitive situations. This means that Zoom <strong>cannot</strong>
                          be used for the purposes of data collection in research, such as interviews with
                          research subjects. More information on Zoom is available

                          If you need to use video calling for research purposes, the best option is
                          Microsoft Teams, however, Teams has also not been officially approved for this purpose.
                          It is therefore advised to discuss it's use with IT Security to determine whether
                          Teams is indeed appropriate for your research purposes.
                          IT Security can also advise on whether any additional
                          measures can be applied to protect the data. IT Security can be contacted

                          E-mailing data without additional security measures is strongly discouraged, even if
                          it seems like the data are anonymous (because the standards that one must meet
                          to call data anonymous are much stricter that many people realize and much of our
                          research data do not meet these standards). The VU has multiple options for sending data safely, so
                          it is advised to use these solutions. See this

                          Unfortunately external PhD candidates are not allowed to use VU-licensed services.
                          These are only to be used by VU employees and students. It is a good idea to check whether
                          the external PhD candidate can make use of services within the institution they are
                          associated with. If that is not possible, an option is to set up a VU guest account,
                          but this can cost a lot of money and it does not necessary guarantee immediate access
                          to VU licensed services; often more steps need to be carried out. Therefore it is
                          advised to contact the

                          Actually, your best option for creating a short URL for your research (and also
                          for any educational purposes) is <a href="https://edu.nl/" target="_blank">edu.nl</a>. This is a service

                          SURF services and the main advantage is that the URL that is created does
                          not track the website visitors, which can be an issue with things like bitly.

                          VU Legal Department, who will review the issue and determine what kind
                          of follow-up is necessary.

                          via <a href="mailto:research.data.fgb@vu.nl">research.data.fgb@vu.nl</a>. Set
                          the message to high priority and include "data breach" in the subject line.
