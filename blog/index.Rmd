*Ok, so technically this isn't really a proper blog right now (i.e. you can't subscribe via RSS), but this is the place you can go to see the latest major changes/updates/announcements related to data support in FGB. I also only implemented this "blog" as of 30 April 2025 and I'm not going to retroactively post previous updates, so apologies if you want to know the history of the changes to these support pages. You'll just have to use your imagination!*
