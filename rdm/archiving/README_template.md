# README

[Remove all text in square brackets. This is only for your instruction]

[If a section below states "if applicable" and the section is not applicable to your case,
remove the section entirely]

[You can add additional information to this README Markdown file as desired. What is below are the minimum requirements.
Start each section with ## and a descriptive title. Start each subsection with ### and a descriptive title.
If you create a subsection of a subsection start with #### and a descriptive title.
For further information on writing in Markdown see https://www.markdownguide.org/]

[For all sections, include enough information for another person to understand and properly interpret your data package]





## Title of Data Package

[Choose a title that describes the entirety of your data package, such as "Data package for {YOUR STUDY NAME}". You could also state "Data Package for {Title of Research Article}", but only if the title of your research article isn't overly long. If this README only describes a portion of the data from your overall study, make that clear in this title, .e.g "Data package for My Great Study: Questionnaire Data"]






## Content(s) of Data Package

[REPEAT THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS (from "Title of file" to "Storage location") FOR EACH DATASET OR SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT INCLUDED IN THE DATA PACKAGE]

### Title of file

[Title of the dataset (e.g. questionnaire data) or document (e.g. codebook for questionnaire data): this does not need to be as detailed as the Title of the Data Package, but instead a brief indicator of what the file consists of]

### Type of file

[E.g. Dataset, software, codebook. You can use the following controlled vocabularies to choose
an appropriate option for the type of file https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#10-resourcetype]
[If the information here overlaps too much with "Title of file" you can remove this section from your README]

### Description of file

[Brief description of the contents of the dataset or document and how they should be interpreted]
[For quantitative data files, such as data tables, include a description of the data structure, i.e. wide vs. long files, number of records (rows)
and variables (columns). If this information is documented in a codebook that is also included in the data package, this
information does not need to be repeated here]

### Version of file

[If applicable]
[Describe which version of the data were used for the research publication]

### Relationship to other files or documents
[If applicable]
[If there are multiple datasets in your data package, describe how to they relate to each other. If the file is supplementary documentation, describe which datafiles this documentation relates to]

### Persistent identifier of file
[If applicable]

### Storage location of file
[If applicable, for example if the file cannot be found via a persistent identifier. This is particularly
important if this file is stored in a different location from all other datasets and documents]







## Period of data collection
[Dates or period of time during which data were collected]
[This section can also be incorporated into the section on "Content of data package" for each file within the data package

differed for each file in the data package. Just make sure to add one extra # to the title "Period of data collection"
when including it
within the "Content of data package section"]






## Data collectors
[List the people who collected the data. Repeat this section from "Name of data collector"
to "persistent identifier of data collector" for each person who was involved with
data collection]
[This section on data collectors
can also be incorporated into the section on "Content of data package" for each file within the data package
if the data collectors were different for each file in the data package.
Just make sure to add one extra # to each title of this
section if you opt to include this information in the "Content of data package" section]

### Name of data collector

### Role of data collector
[The role of this person within the research team, e.g. researcher, research assistant,
laboratory tech, data manager etc.]

### Persistent identifier of data collector
[If available, e.g. ORCID]





## Location(s) of data collection
[If applicable]
[Where were the data collected from]
[This section on locations and contact persons
can also be incorporated into the section on "Content of data package" for each file within the data package
if the locations where data were collected from
differed for each file in the data package. Just make sure to add one extra # to each title for this
section if you opt to include this information in the "Content of data package" section]

### Name of contact person at data collection site
[If applicable. Make sure contact person is aware that this information about them
will be documented in this README.]
[Repeat for each contact person, if appropriate]












## Title of research manuscript
[If applicable. This section does not apply if data are being archived for reasons other than
the publication of a research article]

### Date research manuscript accepted
[Use yyyy-mm-dd format]

### Citation for manuscript

### Persistent identifier of manuscript
[If available, e.g. DOI]

### Co-authors
[REPEAT THE FOLLOWING SECTION FROM "Name of co-author" TO "Persistent identifier of co-author" FOR

[Person who can be contacted for questions about the materials in the data package or for requests
to access the data]
[Can also state in the README: "If contact person is no longer available, please contact research.data.fgb@vu.nl".
This statement will allow readers of the README to contact the faculty's Research and Policy Support Team
should the contact person for the data package is no longer be available]
