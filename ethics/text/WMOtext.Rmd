<h2> When does the WMO apply to research </h2>

The Medical Research Involving Humans Act (a.k.a. *Wet medisch-wettenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen* [WMO](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/legal-framework-for-medical-scientific-research/your-research-is-it-subject-to-the-wmo-or-not){target="_blank"}) applies to research if:

1. The research is medical-scientific research
2. Research subjects must undergo procedures or must follow specific rules of behaviour

The CCMO is the overarching organization that ensures research participants are protected while taking part in WMO research and this organization further explains [the conditions that make research fall under the WMO on this page](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/legal-framework-for-medical-scientific-research/your-research-is-it-subject-to-the-wmo-or-not){target="_blank"}.

<div class="quizInfo">
<!-- this section is is hidden when someone gets to the WMO guidance text from 
the quiz outcomes since it wouldn't make sense to mention the quiz at that point-->

However, this guidance can be confusing or unclear when applied to FGB research, which is why it's recommended to take the short FGB-based quiz (if you haven't already) to determine if the WMO is applies to your research or not.

<!-- following button opens the guidance page with the quiz pre-selected (opting to open a new page for the quiz so as to not navigate away from the WMO info on the current page, but also to allow someone to go to the quiz from the external WMOguidance.html page).-->

<h3> &#10147;Review the submission requirements </h3>

The AUMC METC has strict requirements for what must be submitted for WMO ethical review and how these materials are submitted. Make sure to review the following:

* [Standard Research Dossier (only in Dutch)](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/standaarddossier/){target="_blank"}
  + The information on the standard research dossier is written with AUMC researchers in mind. To ensure that your submission is specific to FGB, review the information in the following sections on [which requirements do not apply to FGB research](#notAppl) or [which aspects require deviations from the standard UMC procedures](#deviate)
* [Summarized submission requirements and submission in the Onderzoeksportaal (only in Dutch)](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/indieningseisen/){target="_blank"}
* [Detailed submission requirements (only in Dutch)](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Indieningseisen-versie-2.0-d.d.-22-08-2025.pdf){target="_blank"}
  + The information in these submission requirements is written with AUMC researchers in mind. To ensure that your submission is specific to FGB, review the information in the following sections on [which requirements do not apply to FGB research](#notAppl) or [which aspects require deviations from the standard UMC procedures](#deviate)
  + Be sure to use only the templates required by the METC, as not using these templates can delay the review process. Use this [template letter for all correspondence with the AUMC METC](http://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A1.-Standaard-aanbiedingsbrief-WMO-oordeel-METC-Amsterdam-UMC-versie-januari-2025.docx) and for all other components of the standard research dossier, use the [CCMO templates in Dutch](https://www.ccmo.nl/onderzoekers/standaardonderzoeksdossier){target="_blank"}. 
      + [English versions of the templates are available](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/standard-research-file-for-research-subject-to-the-dutch-wmo-act){target="_blank"}, if necessary, but note that the METC only reviews the Dutch documentation in your submission.
* [Amsterdam UMC Checklist](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Amsterdam-UMC-Checklist-d.d.-10-10-24.pdf){target="_blank"}
  + This checklist repeats much of the information already detailed in other sections, but is a good reference document. As with other guidance on the AUMC METC page, the information is written with AUMC researchers in mind. To ensure that you don't end up trying to meet requirements that only apply to AUMC researchers, review the information in the following sections on [which requirements do not apply to FGB research](#notAppl) or [which aspects require deviations from the standard UMC procedures](#deviate)

</div>

<div class="subsectionIndented">
<h3 id="deviate"> &#10147;Deviate from standard submission procedure where necessary </h3>

The information on the submission procedures and requirements is written with AUMC researchers in mind. The following deviations on the process apply to you as an FGB researcher:

* [The submission requirements](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Indieningseisen-versie-2.0-d.d.-22-08-2025.pdf){target="_blank"} cite contact information that must be included in the participant information letter, but the contact information listed is for AUMC. As an FGB researcher:
  + For the Data Protection Officer (*Functionaris Gegevensbescherming*), use functionarisgegevensbescherming@vu.nl
  + For complaints (*Klachtenregeling*), these are generally handled via the individual research team, so use the appropriate research team contact information here.
* A declaration that the research site is capable of conducting WMO research is a required part of the standard dossier (see [section I of Standard Research Dossier](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/standaarddossier/){target="_blank"}). For almost all FGB research, this declaration can be made using a research declaration (*onderzoeksverklaring*). A Site Suitability Declaration (*Verklaring Geschiktheid Onderzoeksinstelling*) is *only* applicable when your research involves the use of medicinal products. For more information, see [this page on the CCMO website](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/standard-research-file-for-research-subject-to-the-dutch-wmo-act/i-participating-centres/i2-site-suitability-declaration-vgo-or-research-declaration){target="_blank"}.
  + Use this [template for your research declaration (*onderzoeksverklaring*)](https://www.ccmo.nl/documenten/2015/07/01/standaardonderzoeksdossier-i2-model-onderzoeksverklaring){target="_blank"}
  + If you're using the research declaration (*onderzoeksverklaring*) to declare the suitability of the research site, you must also use this [template](https://www.ccmo.nl/documenten/2019/09/20/k3-model-onderzoekscontract-clinical-trial-agreement-onderzoeker-geinitieerd-onderzoek){target="_blank"} for the Clinical Trial Agreement (required in [section K of Standard Research Dossier](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/standaarddossier/){target="_blank"}). 
      + There are other [Clinical Trial Agreement templates](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/standard-research-file-for-research-subject-to-the-dutch-wmo-act/k-other-documents/k3-clinical-trial-agreements){target="_blank"}, but only use these if your situation requires that you use a declaration form other than the research declaration.
* [Section G of Standard Research Dossier](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/standaarddossier/){target="_blank"} discusses the insurance required to conduct WMO research, however the information listed is exclusive to AUMC researchers. See ["Insurance for WMO research within FGB"](#insurance) for more information on how insurance is organized for WMO research within the VU. 
* In the [Amsterdam UMC Checklist](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Amsterdam-UMC-Checklist-d.d.-10-10-24.pdf){target="_blank"}:
    + There is a subsection within *Studiegegevens* that discusses the use of apps, websites and recordings (*opnames*) on page 6. If you plan to use any third party apps, websites or transcribing services for your research, contact [FGB REPS](mailto:research.data.fgb@vu.nl) for FGB specific guidance, both on which services to use and on what documentation to submit to the AUMC METC.
    + The contact information is once again specific to AUMC. As an FGB researcher:
        + For the Data Protection Officer (*Functionaris Gegevensbescherming*), use functionarisgegevensbescherming@vu.nl
        + For complaints (*Klachtenregeling*), these are generally handled via the individual research team, so use the appropriate research team contact information here.

</div>

<h2 id="aware"> Things you should be aware of </h2>

* Ensure that the number of participants you plan to include is consistent across all submitted documents. For WMO research this will generally be stated in:
  + Your research protocol
  + The [ABR form](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/standard-research-file-for-research-subject-to-the-dutch-wmo-act/b-forms/b1-abr-form){target="_blank"} that you fill in in the *Onderzoeksportaal*
* While UMC researchers are required to complete the BROK (*basiscursus regelgeving en organisatie van klinisch onderzoek*) course, the rules are not as clear for FGB. It is best practice that all researchers conducting WMO research complete either the BROK course or another Good Clinical Practice (GCP) certification. The [BROK course](https://www.umcmedewerkers.nl/kennisbank/brok/){target="_blank"} is preferable to other GCP certifications because it is not limited to research on medicinal products, but to all WMO research as well as relevant non-WMO clinical research.
  + Bear in mind that the BROK course was created for UMC researchers, meaning some aspects may still not apply to you as an FGB researcher. When in doubt, contact [FGB REPS](mailto:research.data.fgb@vu.nl) for support.

<div class="subsectionIndented">
<h3 id="insurance"> &#10147;Insurance for WMO research within FGB </h3>

The AUMC METC will determine if your WMO research requires participants' insurance. If you believe that your research *does not* pose risks to your participants, you must include a written request to the AUMC METC for exemption from this insurance requirement. This written request **must be included in the initial submission of your standard research dossier**. If you are certain that your research *will* require participants' insurance, you will need to include proof of participants' insurance in your submission. Regardless of whether your research requires participants' insurance, you are also required to include proof of liability insurance in your submission. For proof of either type of insurance, contact research.data.fgb@vu.nl for a copy of the relevant documentation.

If you do not request an exemption from requiring participants' insurance or the AUMC METC refuses your request for an exemption, you will need to [register for participants' insurance via this form](https://fgbto3-web.labs.vu.nl/rdm/wmo-insurance/){target="_blank"}. You can only fill in this form *after* you have received approval for your research from an METC. The FGB REPS team collects most registrations from this form once a year in the fall for processing by VU Corporate Finance. You may fill in this form at any time of the year, but if you do so outside of the usual mass registration period (every year in September), please contact research.data.fgb@vu.nl to confirm that your registration has been received.

**NB**: There are no additional costs with liability insurance, but the participants' insurance will be billed to your research project from whichever funding source is applicable to you. This means that if you are obtaining funding from a grant provider, the costs of participants' insurance need to be included in the budgeting. See the next section ["Costs of WMO research and budgeting"](#costs) for more information.
</div>

<div class="subsectionIndented">
<h3 id="costs"> &#10147;Costs of WMO research and budgeting </h3>

WMO research involves many extra costs that need to be estimated and accounted for in your budgeting, especially if you are obtaining funding from an external grant provider. You are expected to cover these costs with your project budget, therefore it's important to estimate what these costs will be **during your grant application**. The primary costs that you need to take into account are:

* The costs of a WMO review by the AUMC METC. For FGB researchers, who are external to the AUMC, the cost is [currently €4000 for research funded by research grants](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/tarieven/wmo-onderzoek/){target="_blank"}. For every [substantial amendment](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/tijdens-en-na-wmo-onderzoek/amendementen/){target="_blank"} that needs to be submitted to the AUMC METC, [you will need to pay €850](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/tarieven/wmo-onderzoek/){target="_blank"}.
* The costs of participants' insurance. If your research requires [participants' insurance](#insurance), there will be additional costs per participant included in the study. For 2026, this cost is €45 per participant.
</div>

<h2 id="notAppl"> Things you don't need to worry about </h2>


The AUMC METC's WMO review process is written with AUMC researchers in mind; some information is not applicable to FGB researchers. The following are some things you can ignore:

* The Amsterdam UMC's [*verwerkingsregister* (processing register)](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/verwerkingsregister/){target="_blank"} is mentioned on their website a few times. You **do not** need to register your research in this processing registry as an FGB researcher; the VU has its own systems for [registering data processing](../legal/GDPRBasics.html#Registration_of_Personal_Data_Processing){target="_blank"} which you *are* required to complete. 
* In the [standard submission dossier](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/standaarddossier/){target="_blank"} you don't need to include anything for section D on "product information" (*productinformatie*) unless you are conducting research with medicinal products or medical devices.
* The information on the [AUMC METC's webpage about *Lokale Uitvoerbaarheid*](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/lokale-uitvoerbaarheid/lu/){target="_blank"} is not applicable to FGB researchers *unless* you are conducting research in partnership with the AUMC *and* that research will take place (in part) at the AUMC.
